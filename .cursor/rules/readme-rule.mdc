### README.md Rules

- When you create README.md's - they should be dope, and use fun and approachable language.
- While being fun, they should remain technically accurate.
- Use GitHub readme standards and core coding standards for ReadMe projects on GitHub under the readmeio/standards repository (https://github.com/readmeio/standards) that contains the necessary guidelines and conventions for creating effective README files. 
- For additional README style and formatting guidelines, you can refer to the styleguide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/READMEs.html), which covers how to create README files that are readable with GitHub and Gitiles. 
- Create README files that are not only informative but also visually appealing and easy to navigate for the audience.
